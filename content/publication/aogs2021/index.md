Abstract.
abstract = "This study examined the response of crop yield (maize, rice, soybean, and wheat) in the Asian monsoon region to meteorological drought during 1981–2016. The meteorological drought index was developed based on multiple timescale SPEI (Standardized Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index) using a global dataset. The crop yield response was assessed using de-trended crop yield based on the global dataset of historical yields in a 0.5 grid resolution. Monthly indices were then obtained in the harvest month of each crop to consider the crop growing period annually. Then the crop yield response to drought was estimated by Pearson correlation and linear regression analysis. Results show that crop yield anomaly is more associated with the 9-month precipitation aggregation of SPEI than the other time scales used in this study (1–12 months). The drought events variations explain approximately 15, 11, 22, and 10% of the total crop area for maize, rice, soybean, and wheat crop, respectively, in the region (p-value < 0.1). By country, China, India, and Indonesia, the three largest crop producers account for around 76% of the region’s total significantly affected crop area. Based on this historical analysis, this study implies that droughts affect crop yield in this region, whose climatic conditions are strongly driven by various global phenomena (e.g., El Niño–Southern Oscillation). This study is also essential for understanding crop-drought vulnerability, particularly for the Asian monsoon region."
