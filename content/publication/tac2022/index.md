abstract = "The global climate models (GCMs) of Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 6 (CMIP6) were used for spatiotemporal projections of precipitation and temperature over Afghanistan for three shared socioeconomic pathways (SSP1-2.6, 2–4.5, and 5–8.5) and two future time horizons, early (2020–2059) and late (2060–2099). The compromise programming (CP) approach was employed to order the GCMs based on their skill to replicate precipitation and temperature climatology for the reference period (1975–2014). Three models, namely, ACCESS-CM2, MPI-ESM1-2-LR, and FIO-ESM-2–0, showed the highest skill in simulating all three variables (precipitation, maximum temperature, and minimum temperature), and therefore, were chosen for the future projections. The ensemble mean of the GCMs showed an increase in maximum temperature by 1.5 − 2.5 °C, 2.7 − 4.3 °C, and 4.5 − 5.3 °C and minimum temperature by 1.3 − 1.8 °C, 2.2 − 3.5 °C, and 4.6 − 5.2 °C for SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, and SSP5-8.5, respectively, in the later period. Meanwhile, the changes in precipitation in the range of − 15 − 18%, − 36 − 47%, and − 40 − 68% for SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, and SSP5-8.5, respectively. The temperature and precipitation were projected to increase in the highlands and decrease over the deserts, indicating dry regions would be drier and wet regions wetter."
